\section{Aksjomaty Euklidesa}
\todofoot{Considered the "father of geometry",[3] he is chiefly known for the Elements treatise, which established the foundations of geometry that largely dominated the field until the early 19th century.}
\todofoot{Very little is known of Euclid's life, and most information comes from the scholars Proclus and Pappus of Alexandria many centuries later. }

\todofoot{The theorem of the gnomon was described as early as in Euclid's Elements (around 300 BC), and there it plays an important role in the derivation of other theorems. It is given as proposition 43 in Book I of the Elements, where it is phrased as a statement about parallelograms without using the term "gnomon". The latter is introduced by Euclid as the second definition of the second book of Elements. Further theorems for which the gnomon and its properties play an important role are proposition 6 in Book II, proposition 29 in Book VI and propositions 1 to 4 in Book XIII.[5][4][6]} % https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem_of_the_gnomon
