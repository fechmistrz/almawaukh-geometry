% The two '''bimedians''' of a convex quadrilateral are the line segments that connect the midpoints of opposite sides. They intersect at the "vertex centroid" of the quadrilateral (see [[Quadrilateral#Remarkable points and lines in a convex quadrilateral|§ Remarkable points and lines in a convex quadrilateral]] below).

% The four '''maltitudes''' of a convex quadrilateral are the perpendiculars to a side—through the midpoint of the opposite side.

% The heyday of synthetic geometry can be considered to have been the 19th century, when analytic methods based on coordinates and calculus were ignored by some geometers such as Jakob Steiner, in favor of a purely synthetic development of projective geometry. For example, the treatment of the projective plane starting from axioms of incidence is actually a broader theory (with more models) than is found by starting with a vector space of dimension three. Projective geometry has in fact the simplest and most elegant synthetic expression of any geometry.
