    $ABC$ is an isosceles triangle with $AB = AC$.
    Suppose that $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$ and $O$ is the point on the line $AM$ such that $OB$ is perpendicular to $AB$; $Q$ is an arbitrary point on the segment $BC$ different from $B$ and $C$; $E$ lies on the line $AB$ and $F$ lies on the line $AC$ such that $E$, $Q$, $F$ are distinct and collinear.
    Prove that $OQ$ is perpendicular to $EF$ if and only if $QE = QF$.
