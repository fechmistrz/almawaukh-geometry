\begin{exercise}[1/2004]
    Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle with $AB \neq AC$.
    The circle with diameter $BC$ intersects the sides $AB$ and $AC$ at $M$ and $N$ respectively.
    Denote by $O$ the midpoint of the side $BC$.
    The bisectors of the angles $\angle BAC$ and $\angle MON$ intersect at R.
    Prove that the circumcircles of the triangles $BMR$ and $CNR$ have a common point lying on the side $BC$.

\begin{exercise}[5/2004]
    In a convex quadrilateral $ABCD$ the diagonal $BD$ does not bisect the angles $ABC$ and $CDA$.
    The point $P$ lies inside $ABCD$ and satisfies $\angle PBC = \angle DBA$ and $\angle PDC = \angle BDA$.
    Prove that $ABCD$ is a cyclic quadrilateral if and only if $AP = CP$.
